WS-2-OneDrive script is free to use *only* for personal, non-commercial use.   

For Commercial Use (as laid-out below) please contacting [Jos Lieben](https://twitter.com/joslieben) to arrange a one-time payment for a perpetual license.

Since this solution utilizes a good deal of code from another solution, written by [Jos Lieben](https://twitter.com/joslieben),
I am bound to observe that author's Licensing and limit open use of this solution to non-commercial use, as laid-out by Jos on his web site here:
 
 https://www.lieben.nu/liebensraum/commercial-use/

"Commercial Use" would mean using this scripted solution as part of 
a service or product that is being paid for by someone.

_For_ _example:_

a managed service provider that uses my scripts in their customer environments
a global IT organization that handles IT projects, for which they are compensated
a software company that (re)uses (parts of) this script  heir commercial software or internal tools used to help paying customers
situations where the script is used in migrations or conversions for paid products or services
a staffing company, where their staff implements my scripts at customer sites where the customer pays (directly or indirectly) for their hours
IT contractors that implement this solution for their customers
This is where these scripts create monetary value, and therefore where I feel it is fair to ask for a (small) piece of the pie to support future work, improvements, advice, support, etc etc.

Therefore, if you wish to use this script in a commercial context as defined above, you must arrange a one-time payment for unlimited 
Commercial Use within one of the tiers laid-out below.   

You can alternatively pay Jos yearly for a non-perpetual license.
